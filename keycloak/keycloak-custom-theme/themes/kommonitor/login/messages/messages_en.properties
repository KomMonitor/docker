termsText=Dear colleagues,<br> \
<br> \
thank you for using our "KomMonitor" portal. We hope that all information, data and analysis functions \
available there can support you in your daily work.<br> \
Your credentials give you access to sensitive data that can only be accessed by a selected group of people \
at the request of the city administration, which provided the initial data for this purpose. Before you register \
for the first time, we are required to inform you about the terms of use for our portal:<br> \
<br> \
1. The information obtained may only be used for business purposes.<br> \
This does not include information that is also accessible in the public area of the portal (without registration). <br> \
<br> \
2. Your credentials must not be passed on to anyone. <br> \
We are happy to provide your colleagues with their own access data if they want to use our portal for business purposes.<br> \
<br> \
3. To protect against misuse, the portal's access protocols can be checked on a random basis and if there is a specific suspicion of misuse.<br> \
<br> \
4. In the event of abuse, access rights can be withdrawn and the superior authority can be informed.<br> \
<br> \
Please confirm that you have understood the terms of use and will comply with them.<br> \
<br> \
We wish you a lot of success in your work with our portal and are available at any time to answer any questions.
